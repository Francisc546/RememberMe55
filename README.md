Eidolon prototype v1 (Currently in revision status for CHI 2025 student's game competition) - More info can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbwCPxgXXg4 Last update 23-01-2025

Escape room prototype developed alongside my colleague Filipe Tomé, narrative writer and game designer.
This project had the code name "Remember Me", started out as the idea of bringing to life the 5 stages of grief in a narrative first person game, each stage of grief would be a small escape room. 
Players would have to find the clues to solve the puzzles and move on through the level until they finish that stage of grief. 
The idea is to visual protray the characteristic of each of the mental stages, with change in the layout of the house we're in (that would be our character's house and of the person they're griefing, in this case their sister).

v1 - We developed the first stage of grief, denial. 
This prototype was developed in a very short time frame, making use of tool such as Rokoko suit for animating a metahuman, these animations were polished and tweaked; 
We leveraged the use of Unreal Engine's 5.5 metahuman lipsync to use our VO audios to create the lipsync animations;


The game was tested internally at our lab with 13 participants, we collected the data and took note of much needed improvements for a future update of this version and further development of other stages.
We took note of the following issues:
-Too many inputs for the user;
-Clues not being very perceptible for the users;
-UI issues with overlapping or low contrast reading text;

Future work - Improve the flaws from encountered in testing, alongside the design and development of the other stages.
